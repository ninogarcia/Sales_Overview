# Project Overview
In this portfolio, I demonstrate my expertise in data analysis by working with a sales dataset. The dataset contains comprehensive information about sales transactions, including product details, customer information, and transaction dates. The stakeholders' primary interest lies in gaining a deep understanding of the sales trends and performance throughout the year 2011. To meet this goal, I employ various analytical techniques, create informative visualizations, and address specific questions that are of utmost importance to the stakeholders.

This analysis provides information about the average number of units purchased per transaction for each month in 2011, offering insights into customer buying behavior.
Data Analysis and Insights

By employing various analytical techniques and SQL queries, I address the above questions and derive meaningful insights. The analysis encompasses a wide range of metrics, visualizations, and tables to present the findings effectively and comprehensively. These insights empower stakeholders to make informed decisions and strategic plans that capitalize on the trends and patterns revealed by the data.

Visualizations
The analysis is enriched with visual representations such as line charts and tables, which facilitate the communication of insights to stakeholders. These visualizations enable a clear and concise understanding of the sales trends and performance metrics for the year 2011.

Conclusion
Through this comprehensive data analysis, I provide stakeholders with valuable insights into the sales performance of the year 2011. The answers to the stakeholders' questions shed light on various facets of sales trends, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning. These insights hold the potential to enhance sales strategies and optimize business performance in the future.
